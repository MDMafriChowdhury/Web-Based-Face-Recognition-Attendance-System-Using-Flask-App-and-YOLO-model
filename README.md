# Web-Based Face Recognition Attendance System Using Flask App and YOLO model

## Installation

Clone or download this repository to your computer.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required dependencies.
```bash
pip install Flask opencv-python numpy Pillow pyOpenSSL
```

## Download Haar Cascade File

Download the Haar Cascade file required for face detection.

- File name: haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

- Source: OpenCV GitHub (data/haarcascades)

- Click Raw, then right-click and select Save As...

- Save it in the same directory as app.py.

```

## Usage
```bash
python app.py
```
After starting, the terminal will show a message similar to:
```pgsql
[INFO] To access from your phone, use https://<ip>:5000
```
# Access the Application

- Make sure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

- Open your browser and go to the HTTPS address shown in the terminal, for example:
https://192.168.1.10:5000

- Accept the browser's security warning by clicking:
Advanced → Proceed to [your IP address] (unsafe)

# Train a New User
```text
1. Click "Train New User" on the main page.
2. Enter the user’s name and click "Start Training".
3. Follow the 7-stage guided capture process:
   - Look Straight
   - Look Left
   - Look Right
   - Look Up
   - Look Down
   - Close
   - Far
4. Wait while the model trains automatically (10–30 seconds).
5. Once complete, click "Back to App".
```

# Take Attendance
```text
1. Open the main page again.
2. Point your camera at your face.
3. When the UI displays:
   Detected: [Your Name] (xx%)
4. Click "Check In" or "Check Out" to record attendance.

```
Smart attendance logic ensures:
- A user cannot check in twice.
- A user cannot check out without checking in.

# Technologies Used

Flask – Web framework for backend logic

- OpenCV (LBPH) – Face detection and recognition

- SQLite – Local database for users and attendance logs

- HTML5 / JavaScript – Frontend interface

- pyOpenSSL – Enables HTTPS for browser camera access
